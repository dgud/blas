// strsm stands for "solve triangular system of linear equations with multiple right-hand sides".
// It solves the system of linear equations A*X = B, where A is a triangular matrix.

// Inputs:
// A is a triangular matrix of size m x m stored in column-major order in array A.
// B is a matrix of size m x n stored in column-major order in array B.
// Side is an enum value that specifies whether A is an upper or lower triangular matrix.
// Uplo is an enum value that specifies whether A is an upper or lower triangular matrix.
// Diag is an enum value that specifies whether A is unit triangular or not.

// Function call:
cblas_strsm(CblasColMajor, Side, Uplo, CblasNoTrans, Diag, m, n, alpha, A, m, B, n);

// Expected outputs:
// B is an m x n matrix stored in column-major order in array B, containing the solution X.
// The elements of B are overwritten with the solution X.
