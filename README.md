THIS REPO IS DEAD and will NOT be updated
=========================================

The erlang implementation of BLAS have been re-written and moved.

This was an old attempt, of a first rough implementation.

Interruptable/dirty scheduler nifs, range tests in the nif,
Makefiles/configure, tests and documentation needs more work.

Was only limited tested with ATLAS on Ubuntu-14.04 (libatlas-dev package)
